## Advent of Code 2015

I went back to 2015, in 2024, and did a bunch of days because I was bored.
All of my solutions this year are in Go (1.23.2)

| Day | Solution                | Difficulty (IMO) |
| --- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | [Solution](/2015/day-1) | 1/10             |
| 2   | [Solution](/2015/day-2) | 3/10             |
| 3   | [Solution](/2015/day-3) | 4/10             |
| 4   | [Solution](/2015/day-4) | 2/10             |
| 5   | [Solution](/2015/day-5) | 4/10             |
